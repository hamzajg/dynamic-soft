## Status

Accepted <!-- [Draft, Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md)] -->

## Context

Traditional architectures resist change, posing challenges in accommodating evolving business needs, technological shifts, or emerging market trends. Adapting a system to new requirements without a flexible architecture can accumulate technical debt, hindering future development and innovation. Inflexible architectures often lead to a slow time-to-market, impeding the timely delivery of valuable features and improvements to end-users.

## Decision

To address these challenges, we has decided to adopt Evolutionary Architecture principles, emphasizing incremental, guided change. ADRs will be used to document key architectural decisions, ensuring transparency, traceability, and a shared understanding of the evolving architecture.

## Consequences

Adaptability: Evolutionary Architecture enables the system to adapt to changing requirements, technologies, and business conditions.

Reduced Technical Debt: Incremental changes, guided by architectural principles, help manage and reduce technical debt over time.

Faster Time-to-Market: The ability to make incremental changes results in a faster time-to-market, allowing the team to respond quickly to user needs and market demands.
